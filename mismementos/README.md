## About

Mis Mementos is a fullstack app that allows users to highlight different memories. Considering that we are all removed from our daily world with COVID-19 we wanted to create an app that highlighted our cherished memoreies. This app was created with three models using object relationship mapping.

## Features
Users are able to log in with their profile and create their memories. Their memories are displayed on a map and they have the ability to edit their memory.

## Getting Started
To use our fullstack app, users will open their terminal and run the following commands for two different repos:

## For the backend it is crucial that you first bundle install. Next steps:

- rails db:create
- rails db:migrate
- rails db:seed
- rails s
## To run the frontend repo
- npm install
- npm start

Have the rails server running on "localhost:3000"

## Stack
Javascript/ React
Ruby on Rails
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
jQuery
